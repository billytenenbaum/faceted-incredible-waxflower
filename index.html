            "What a day! The meetings dragged on for hours while people just yakked and yakked without ever saying anything. Marie was in a foul mood and made sure that everybody knew it. Steve was his usual boasting self. While you were wasting time in meetings, the phone messages and emails were piling up at your desk. And Brad... damn, he couldn't manage his way out of a paper bag. \n\nYou didn't get back to your desk until 5:00, and you decided to call it quits for the day. You clawed your way through traffic, but made an impulsive decision to take the right turn leading up into the hills. You have a special place about ten miles out. You pull into the little turnout at the side of the road and head up the faint trail. After a few hundred yards, you break away from the trail, shove your way through some brush for fifty yards, and reach your special place: a big rock at the top of a slope, from which you can look out across the canyon and see a panorama of pure nature. You sit down on the rock and take in the view. It's so relaxing. You're shielded from the noise and hubbub of the city by an intervening ridge, and here there's nothing but peace and nature. You take a deep breath and smile. You're at your special place. You close your eyes and think clean, natural thoughts. \n\nIn this state of mind, time can pass quickly or slowly; only the slow lengthening of the shadows as the sun nears the horizon gives you any sense of the passage of time. You are jolted out of your reverie by the sound of something crashing through the brush. Alarmed, you look all around, but the sound stops and you can't figure out where it came from. Is there some kind of animal out here? You've heard that mountain lions sometimes come out of the hills and get this close to the city--could that sound have been a mountain lion? The sound resumes, and it's definitely getting closer. Your eyes widen and you strain your ears to locate the source. Whatever it is, it's big and its approaching. Your heart is pounding and you start to stand up, when a person appears, breaking through the last branches of brush. It's a woman; a branch snags her blouse and she works to free it before sees you for the first time. She jerks backwards in fright.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" she blurts. \"Uh...\" She stares at you in confusion and fear.",

But no, on closer inspection, you realize that she\'s not Asian.\n\nShe\'s wearing jeans, a lumberjack\'s shirt, and solid boots; ideal apparel for fighting through this heavy brush. For a moment, you wonder if she isn\'t perhaps a fireman... er, firewoman... whatever. \n\n"What\'s your name?" \n\nShe pauses, looking at you quizzically, then answers, "I\'m Sam." \n\n"Nice to meet you, Sam. I\'m Jeff." \n\nAgain she pauses, then answers "Hello, Jeff." \n\n"So, uh, Sam, you seem to be quite an explorer, pushing through dense brush like this."\n\n"No", she says, "I discovered this spot a year ago, and I come here whenever I need to think. When did you find it?"\n\nYou are taken aback; you only found this place about five months ago.',

But the marketing lady is asking some important questions. You give quick answers, but she keeps asking more questions. Finally you blurt, \"I'm really sorry, Melinda, but I've got a 12:30 lunch appointment.\" Melinda is obviously displeased, but she makes no objection. You dart out of the conference room and rush to the elevator. It is above your floor and moving up, one floor at a time. You use the stairs. It seems as if you reach the end of each block just as the \"Don't Walk\" sign turns on. Fuming at the delays, finally reach Vico's at 12:38.
